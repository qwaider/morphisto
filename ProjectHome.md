Morphisto is a morphological analyzer and generator for German wordforms. The basis of Morphisto is the open-source SMOR morphology for the German language developed by the University of Stuttgart (GPL v2) for which a free lexicon is provided under the Creative Commons 3.0 BY-SA Non-Commercial license.

The Morphisto lexicon was originally developed at the [Institute for the German Language, Mannheim (Germany)](http://www.ids-mannheim.de) as part of the [TextGrid project](http://www.textgrid.de). This site hosts the new central place to go on the net for everything regarding Morphisto: Bugfixes and improvements, new feature, utilities, and getting in touch with the developers.

Morphisto requires as dependency the SFST toolkit available from the [University of Stuttgart](http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/gramotron/SOFTWARE/SFST.html), as well as a computer running a contemporary Unix distribution (Ubuntu, Debian, OSX, you name it). If you want to compile your own Morphisto automaton a minimum of 8 GB RAM is highly recommended. However, this site also provides pre-compiled automatons.
Windows users and the impatient ones can play with the Morphisto web-services available in the [TextGridLab](http://www.textgrid.de/beta.html) and hosted [here](http://ingrid.sub.uni-goettingen.de/cgi-bin/analyze.cgi).

Participation is always welcome! If you just have some fixes to contribute regarding the lexicon of Morphisto, feel free to use the issue tracker or get in contact with us!
